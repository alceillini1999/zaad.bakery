Zaad Bakery â€” MPA Split (Option A)

This splits your dashboard by pages while keeping your server.js and app.js intact.

Pages:
- index.html (Sales)
- expenses.html
- credit.html
- orders.html
- cash.html
- employees.html
- reports.html

Deploy:
- Put these HTML files under your public/ folder in the repo Render uses.
- No API changes, server.js stays the same.
